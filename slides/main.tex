  \frametitle{Why scrum?}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Waterfall is not working $\rightarrow$ Not able to release a
    product faster than a year at a time.
  \item Can update product with every sprint, every 3-4 weeks every
    team releases. Now the company releases the product 3-4 times per year.
    release a
  \item Company started implemented SCRUM a long time ago, still
    ongoing.
  \item Sprint defines the work for 3-4 weeks. None are allowed to
    interrupt you during this period.
  \item Provide greater efficiency.
  \item Stakeholder means different things in different contexts.
  \item stakeholders: make someone responseable for something?
    feauture to develop, stakeholder, other feature that are using
    your feature.
  \item Stakeholders come from interactions between features and teams.
  \item Cross competence team, within one teams solve difficult stuff.
